# Clutter_counter

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow?style=for-the-badge)

Clutter counter takes an image of a household space, such as a drawer or desk, identifies the objects within the image, confrims these with the user and then stores those labels to be searched for later. 

This project is still in development and I will continue to add new features here as I go.

## Usage
Currently this project can be run within terminal. 
You will be prompted to enter a folder which contains at least one image of household items. 

Please note, since this project is still in development it is set to use a function that re-load previous data from the image identification API rather than the function that queries it, to avoid repetative queries during testing. 

## Upcoming_features
The features below are either in progress or up the pipeline
- Search for an object.
- Delete an object.
- Rename or add a new location to an object. 
- Instead of storing results in a csv, store them in a SQL database
- Check if an object found in a new photo is one that is already in the database. If it is, update that object instead of creating a new one.

## Contributing
Thank you for any interest in contributing! Right now, I am using this project as a space to develop and learn new skills and not looking for contribution. That being said, if you have some ideas or are particularly keen to join me on this, please reach out!
